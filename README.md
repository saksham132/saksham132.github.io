## 🧬 About Me

I am a biomedical researcher passionate about uncovering the mechanisms that drive human diseases and translating scientific discoveries into therapeutic insights. Trained as a mechanical engineer at IIT Kanpur, my curiosity in cellular biology and genomics inspired a career pivot toward biomedical research. 

I currently work at the **Fred Hutch Cancer Center** in Seattle as a **Post-baccalaureate Research Technician**, where I study RIT1-driven lung cancer models using single-cell and epigenomic techniques. My long-term goal is to become an independent investigator developing innovative approaches in cancer biology and genomics to improve human health.
